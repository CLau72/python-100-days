# This program will be for playing hangman. The basic logic will be:
# Step 1: Select a random word from a word list
# Step 2: Get the length of the word to generate blanks
# Step 3: Prompt User for letter input
# Step 4: Put letters in answer or lose life based on answer
# Step 5: Repeat 4-5 until either you win or die
